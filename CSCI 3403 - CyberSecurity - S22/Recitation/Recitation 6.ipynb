Commonly used browsers are `Mozilla Firefox`, `Google Chrome`, `Microsoft Edge`, `Apple Safari` and `Opera`, etc. We have learnt many web basics from lectures. \n","\n","Now let us practice using the browser built-in tools, including inspector, console, and debugger, to look at and modify the HTML/JS code. In addition, we will also check the network log to inspect the network requests.\n","\n","Looking Around\n","---------------\n","_Note: The following directions work on Firefox and Chrome. Other browsers may vary._  \n","\n","Open we can access the built-in browser tools by going to the browser menu > \"More tools\" > \"Web Developer Tools\", or using the hotkey Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+I (Mac).\n","\n","**HTML Inspector**  \n","Start by going to any webpage and selecting the \"Inspector\" tab (Firefox) or \"Elements\" tab (Chrome), which displays the HTML of the current page. Notice that you can search through the entire page, and open tags to see their nested tags. You can also jump to a particular element by right-clicking it on the page and selecting \"Inspect\". Make a couple changes- see if you can edit some text, or change an image. Notice as well that your changes go away if you refresh the page.\n","\n","**JavaScript Console**  \n","Select the \"Console\" tab. Here, you can run JavaScript. Some websites, like Google, have security controls to prevent this. Most websites do not- you can run commands on colorado.edu with no problems. Here are a few things you can try:\n","- Create a small pop-up: `alert(\"Hello world!\")`\n","- Print the document cookies: `console.log(document.cookie)`\n","- Replace text on the webpage: `document.body.innerHTML = document.body.innerHTML.replace(\"Students\", \"L33t hackerz\")`\n","- Change the URL: `document.location = \"https://csci3403.com\"`\n","\n","**Network Viewer**  \n","One of the most important tools for our purposes is the network viewer. Go to the \"Network\" tab, which lists each network call made to the site. Load a webpage in a private browsing window- once again, colorado.edu is a good example. Notice that the first request is a request for the home page of the website. After loading and parsing the home page, the next requests load all the other resources on the page separately- each CSS and JavaScript file, image, or other piece of content which was in the initial HTML code is loaded as a separate request. Note that on most sites, colorado.edu included, there are many requests to external webpages. These could be loading images, JavaScript libraries, or other resources to include in the main page, and are also used by advertisers to track which sites you visit.\n","\n","Scroll through the requests, look at the various sub-menus with detailed information. The \"Headers\" section is especially useful: See if you can answer these questions based just off the metadata in the headers:\n","- What browser and operating system are you running on? What versions?\n","- What language is your browser set to use?\n","- What web server is the site running on? What version?\n","\n","**Cookies**  \n","Finally, launch chess.com and go to the \"Storage\" (Firefox) or \"Application\" (Chrome) tab, and select \"Cookies\" from the menu on the left. This lets you see all the cookies which are saved for a given site. These cookies are often used to uniquely identify your browser session, for authentication or for advertising. Which cookies do you see? Cookies with the HttpOnly attribute are only sent through HTTP headers, and cannot be read or set through JavaScript. Try printing `document.cookie` in the console, and notice how the HttpOnly cookies are missing. Secure cookies are only sent if the connection is encrypted with HTTPS. While many cookies are unique to a particular website, common cookies are often documented somewhere online, so try looking up their names and seeing what they are used for."],"metadata":{"id":"3U9hXHHJWxX5"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"7GN5Hjek6zqe"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
