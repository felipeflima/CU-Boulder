2. One of the clients connects to an FTP server during the trace.
    a. What is the IP address and DNS hostname of the server it connects to?
        IP:10.0.2.1 , DNS Hostname: XS4ALL
    b. Based on the packet capture, what’s one major vulnerability of the FTP protocol?
         Data is in plaintext
    c. Name at least two other common network protocols that can be used in place of FTP to provide secure file transfer.
        SFTP and TCP

3. The trace shows that at least one of the clients makes HTTPS connections to sites other
than Facebook. Pick one of these connections and answer the following:
    a. What is the domain name of the site the client is connecting to?
        up.nytimes.com
    b. Is there any way the HTTPS server can protect against the leak of domain name information from part (a)?
        No, DNS would have to be encrypted.
    c. At the very beginning of an HTTPS, the client and server agree on a cipher suite to use and exchange encryption keys. How many cipher suites does the client support?
        Change Cipher Spec (20)
    d. What cipher suite does the server choose for the connection?
        ECDH
    e. Who verified the server’s identity by signing their certificate?
        elb.amazonaws.com

4. One of the clients makes a number of requests to Facebook.
    a. Facebook processes logins over HTTPS, so that user’s passwords are encrypted. Despite this, what is insecure about the way that Facebook authenticates the user?
        To authenticate with Facebook, the browser uses a cookie, which is accessible when the user sends other HTTP requests.
    b. How could this allow an attacker to impersonate a user on Facebook?
        An attacker could use the user’s cookies as their own. 
    c. How can this type of attack be prevented?
        By marking all cookies with the secure attribute and providing automatic redirects from HTTP pages to their HTTPS counterparts.
    d. What did the user do on Facebook?
        Loged in and messaged a friend.
