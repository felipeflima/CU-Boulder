#include <iostream>

1. What is a reference? What is a pointer? How are they different?

2. Given the following class definition, how would you call the method CalculateMysteries?

class Foo {
public:
  Foo(int bar) : bar_(bar) {}

  int CalculateMysteries();

  static int TotalBars();

private:
  int bar_;

  static int baz_;
};

int main(){
    Foo f(10);
    f.CalculateMysteries();
}
