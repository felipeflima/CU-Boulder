/** 
 * Algorithm: converts seconds into hours, minutes and seconds
 *  1. delcare variable seconds
 *  2. declare variable minutes and assign value
 *  3. declare variable f_sec and assign value
 *  4. declare variable hours and assign value
 *  5. declare variable f_min and assign value
 *  6. divide seconds by 60 to find minutes
 *  7. mod seconds by 60 to find the remainder for seconds
 *  8. divide minutes by 60 to find hours
 *  9. mod minutes by 60 to find remainder for minutes
 *  10. output: x hour(s) y minute(s) z second(s)
 *  11. test for 2 cases
