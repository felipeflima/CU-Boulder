/** 
 * Algorithm: simulate a portion of the control software for a vehicle-- control the doors
 *  1.  create a function called vehicle
 *  2. take the all the variables values and pass it to the function
 *  3. check if the car is in conditions to be unlocked from all means
 *      if yes, check if one of the means to open from each side is activated and display message that all doors open
 *      if not, check if one of the sides are activates and display message that the doors of the activated side will open
 *      if not (nothing was activated), all doors stay closed
 *  4. check if the master lock or the gear are not in the position for the doors to open
 *      if yes, both doors stay closed
 *  5. check if child lock is on (prevents door from being open from the inside) and masterlock is unlocked and gear is at 'P'
 *      if yes, check if one of the means to open the door from outside from each side is activated and display message that all doors open
 *      if not, check if one of the sides are activates and display message that the doors of the activated side will open
 *      if not, check if only the inside handles are activated, display both doors stay closed
 *      if not (nothing was activated), all doors stay closed
 *  6. test cases
