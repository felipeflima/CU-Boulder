Given a singly-linked list class, add a C++ member function to create a new node after a node with a given key value.
The value of the new node should be the sum of the values that are immediately before and immediately after the given node value.
The function should be a void function and take in the following argument:

value: integer to search for in the linked list

You can assume the specified value will not be in the head or tail of the LL. Your function can assume only a single instance of the key in the linked list.
