    "# CSCI 3202, Spring 2022: Final Coding Project\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is your final programming project for CSCI 3202. It is due on Canvas by **11:59 PM on Saturday April 30**.  Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/LateX directly below the associated question. Your solutions to computational questions should include any relevant Python code, as well as results and any written commentary.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two options for completing your final project for this course. The first option is presented in this notebook and involves implementing a reinforcement learning algorithm and producing a five-minute video that explains your process of solving this problem. The second option is to design your own project that includes the algorithms we've discussed since the midterm - Bayes Nets, Hidden Markov Models, Markov Decision Processes, or Reinforcement Learning - or an algorithm related to one of these that we haven't discussed in class. Your project also needs to include some kind of analysis of how it performed on a specific problem. If you're interested in the design your own project option, you need to discuss your idea with one of the course instructors to get approval. If you do a project without getting approval, you will receive a 0 regardless of the quality of the project. You will also need to produce a short, five-minute video that explains your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The rules:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose EITHER the given problem to submit OR choose your own project topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If you choose your own project topic, please adhere to the following guidelines:\n",
    "- The project needs to be approved by the course instructors.\n",
    "- The project needs to include one of the algorithms we've discussed since the midterm - Bayes Nets, HMMs, MDPs, or Reinforcement Learning - or an algorithm that we haven't discussed in class. \n",
    "- If you do your own project without prior approval, you will receive a 0 for this project.\n",
    "- Your project code, explanation, and results must all be contained in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. All work, code and analysis must be **your own**.\n",
    "4. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbook, in-class notebooks and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions, like the form of a probability distribution function, or how to perform a particular operation in Python. You may not use entire segments of code as solutions to any part of this project, e.g. if you find a Python implementation of policy iteration online, you can't use it.\n",
    "5. You may **not** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "6. **You may not collaborate with classmates or anyone else.**\n",
    "7. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your final exam. So, we will be much less helpful than we typically am with homework. For example, we will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "8. If you have a question, post it first as a **private** Piazza message. If we decide that it is appropriate for the entire class, then we will make it a public post (and anonymous).\n",
    "9. If something is left open-ended, it is probably because we intend for you to code it up however you want, and only care about the plots/analysis we see at the end. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of these rules will result in an **F** and a trip to the Honor Code council.\n",

Each state is a 1 unit cube. So when $L=2$ (for example), there are cubes centered at each $x=0,1,2$, $y=0,1,2$ and so on, for a total state space size of $3^3 = 27$ states.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before moving on to Part B, we recommend that you test that your MDPLanding code is set up correctly. Write unit tests that display the actions for a given state, rewards, results, etc. This will help you identify errors in your implementation and save you a lot of debugging time later."

This means you need to create some kind of array-like structure such that its first element is the mean of the first 500 trials' cumulative rewards; its second element is the mean of the 501-1000th trials' cumulative rewards; and so on. Make a plot of the block mean rewards as the training progresses. It should increase from about -0.5 initially to somewhere around +0.8.\n",
